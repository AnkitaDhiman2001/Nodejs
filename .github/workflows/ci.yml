    branches: [ "main" ]     # Run when code is pushed to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]     # Run on PRs targeting main

  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # Run job on latest Ubuntu VM

    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Get code from GitHub
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # 2️⃣ Setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"   # Match your project Node version

      # 3️⃣ Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # 4️⃣ Run tests (right now you don’t have tests, so we make a dummy step)
      - name: Run tests
        run: echo "No tests yet! 🚀"

  # ✅ Optional: Deployment checks
  # Railway auto-deploys on push → so we don’t need to add a deploy step.
  # If in future you want manual approvals before Railway deploys,
  # we can extend this with "environments" and "required reviewers".
